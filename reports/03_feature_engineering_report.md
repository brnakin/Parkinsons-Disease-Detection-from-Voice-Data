# Feature Engineering Report
## Parkinson's Disease Detection from Voice Data

### Executive Summary

This report presents the comprehensive feature engineering phase for the Parkinson's Disease Detection project, where we successfully created 5 new composite voice biomarkers designed to enhance the discriminative power of our machine learning models. Through rigorous statistical validation, all new features demonstrated significant differences between healthy individuals and Parkinson's disease patients, with several achieving large effect sizes.

## 1. Background and Motivation

### 1.1 Project Context
Based on our comprehensive EDA analysis, we identified 22 significant voice features with strong discriminative power between Parkinson's and healthy groups. The top performing features included:

- **spread1** (Cohen's d = 1.65) - Frequency variation measure
- **PPE** (Cohen's d = 1.55) - Pitch period entropy  
- **DFA** (Cohen's d = 1.36) - Detrended fluctuation analysis
- **MDVP:Fo(Hz)** (Cohen's d = -0.90) - Fundamental frequency
- **MDVP:Flo(Hz)** (Cohen's d = -0.89) - Minimum fundamental frequency

### 1.2 Feature Engineering Rationale

**Why Create Composite Features?**

1. **Clinical Interpretability**: Combine related measurements into clinically meaningful indices
2. **Noise Reduction**: Averaging multiple measurements can reduce individual measurement noise
3. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Capture broader aspects of vocal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease
4. **Model Performance**: Provide additional discriminative features for machine learning algorithms
5. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Leverage understanding of voice pathology to create targeted measures

### 1.3 Scientific Foundation

Parkinson's disease affects the motor control system, leading to specific vocal impairments:
- **Frequency Instability**: Difficulty maintaining consistent pitch
- **Amplitude Variation**: Irregular loudness control
- **Voice Quality Degradation**: Increased breathiness and noise
- **Reduced Vocal Range**: Limited frequency and amplitude dynamics

Our feature engineering approach directly targets these pathophysiological mechanisms.

## 2. Feature Engineering Methodology

### 2.1 Design Principles

Our feature creation followed established biomedical engineering principles:

**Key Design Criteria:**
- **Physiological Relevance**: Each feature maps to known vocal impairments in Parkinson's
- **Numerical Stability**: Robust to outliers and edge cases (e.g., division by zero)
- **Statistical Power**: Demonstrated discriminative ability between groups
- **Clinical Interpretability**: Clear meaning for healthcare practitioners

### 2.2 Feature Categories

We created features across four key domains of vocal function:

| Domain | Feature | Clinical Focus |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Frequency Stability** | jitter_stability_ratio | Vocal pitch control |
| **Amplitude Control** | shimmer_composite | Voice loudness regulation |
| **Voice Quality** | voice_quality_index | Harmonic-noise balance |
| **Vocal Range** | frequency_range, frequency_cv | Pitch dynamics |

## 3. Implemented Features

### 3.1 Jitter Stability Ratio

**Formula**: `MDVP:Jitter(%) / (MDVP:Jitter(Abs) + 1e-8)`

**Clinical Significance**: 
- Measures relative frequency variation normalized by absolute variation
- Higher values indicate less stable vocal frequency control
- Parkinson's patients show increased jitter due to motor control deficits

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added small epsilon (1e-8) to prevent division by zero
- Combines relative (%) and absolute (seconds) jitter measurements
- Creates dimensionless stability index

### 3.2 Shimmer Composite Score

**Formula**: `(MDVP:Shimmer + Shimmer:APQ3 + Shimmer:APQ5) / 3`

**Clinical Significance**:
- Comprehensive amplitude variation measure
- Averages three complementary shimmer measurements
- Elevated values indicate poor vocal amplitude control in Parkinson's

**Technical Implementation**:
- Simple arithmetic mean of three validated shimmer measures
- Reduces measurement noise through averaging
- Maintains physiological interpretability

### 3.3 Voice Quality Index

**Formula**: `HNR / (NHR + 1)`

**Clinical Significance**:
- Combines harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR)
- Higher values indicate better voice quality
- Parkinson's patients typically show reduced voice quality

**Technical Implementation**:
- Ratio of signal quality measures
- Added constant (1) to NHR denominator for numerical stability
- Creates unified voice quality metric

### 3.4 Frequency Range

**Formula**: `MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - MDVP:Flo(Hz)`

**Clinical Significance**:
- Measures vocal frequency range (pitch dynamics)
- Parkinson's patients often show reduced frequency range
- Indicates vocal motor control capacity

**Technical Implementation**:
- Simple difference between maximum and minimum fundamental frequencies
- Direct measure of vocal pitch range
- Physiologically interpretable in Hz

### 3.5 Frequency Coefficient of Variation

**Formula**: `frequency_range / MDVP:Fo(Hz)`

**Clinical Significance**:
- Normalizes frequency range by average fundamental frequency
- Accounts for individual differences in baseline vocal pitch
- Higher values suggest greater relative frequency instability

**Technical Implementation**:
- Relative measure independent of absolute pitch
- Normalizes for individual vocal characteristics
- Creates dimensionless frequency variability index
